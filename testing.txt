1. There should be an index page in your folder.
2. No password encryption for admin and user
3. After register there was no message to notify user about successful registration 
4. There is no primary key in admin table
5. href="/Journal-Project-using-PHP/Admin panel/pending_items/journals.php" wrong way to give path. Correct is href="pending_items/journals.php"
6. Show message on journal page if there is no pending journals in admin panel and same for all.
7. If I approve or reject a journal or event etc then page should be refreshed automatically.
